“Platform” – Nexabyte’s proprietary templates, code, deployment tooling and documentation.

“Initial Term” – the fixed commitment period selected in the Order Form (12 months for the Boost Plan or 18 months for the Grow Plan).

3 Licence & Intellectual Property
3.1 We grant the Client a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, worldwide licence to use the Website for its business during the Subscription Term. 3.2 Except for Client Content, all IP rights in the Platform and Website remain with Nexabyte. Source code is not transferred unless the Client purchases a Buy‑Out Licence (Clause 16.3).

4 Client Responsibilities
Provide timely Content and approvals; ensure Content is accurate and lawful; indemnify Nexabyte against third‑party claims arising from Client Content.

5 Fees & Payment
Fees are set out in the Order Form and exclusive of VAT.

The first month's fee is due on acceptance; monthly fees are collected automatically via Stripe or GoCardless.

Failed payments follow the dunning schedule in Clause 10.

Nexabyte may increase the Sustain Plan fee on 30 days’ notice after the Initial Term.

6 Term & Renewal
6.1 The Agreement runs for the Initial Term and renews automatically for successive one‑month periods unless either party gives 30 days’ written notice. 6.2 Nexabyte will email a renewal reminder at least 30 days before the Initial Term ends, in line with UK subscription regulations.

7 Deliverables Ownership & Source Code
All deliverables are licensed, not sold. The Client may request a static HTML export on termination (Clause 16.2) or buy full editable source under Clause 16.3.

8 Warranties
We warrant Services will be provided with reasonable skill and care and that the Website will meet any performance targets set out in the Order Form. All other warranties are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Next‑business‑day email support (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00 UK time).

Target 99.9 % monthly uptime; critical incidents monitored 24 × 7.

10 Late Payment & Suspension
Nexabyte’s billing platform will automatically attempt up to 8 payment retries within 14 days, using smart retry intervals; reminder emails are sent after each attempt.

If payment remains outstanding after the final retry (typically Day 14), Nexabyte may pause the Website on Day 30.

If payment remains outstanding 45 days after suspension, Nexabyte may terminate and delete the live site after secure backup.
