# RapidSite Voice & Messaging Guide

*Version 1.0 – 7 July 2025*

## 1. Voice Overview

**RapidSite's voice: Your Website Partner**

We're not another web agency. We're the small business owner's trusted website partner - warm, reliable, and refreshingly honest. We speak like real humans about real business problems, not tech specs and corporate jargon.

---

## 2. Voice Principles

### 2.1 Simple & Jargon-Free
- **Do:** "We handle the technical stuff"
- **Don't:** "Enterprise-grade infrastructure with CDN deployment"
- **Why:** Small business owners want clarity, not complexity

### 2.2 Confidence-Building
- **Do:** "Your site will be ready in 7 days"
- **Don't:** "We aim to deliver projects in a timely manner"
- **Why:** Address uncertainty with clear, confident promises

### 2.3 Outcome-Focused
- **Do:** "More customers finding you online"
- **Don't:** "Search engine optimized with meta tags"
- **Why:** Talk business results, not technical features

### 2.4 Warm & Personal
- **Do:** "Coffee's on us"
- **Don't:** "Schedule a consultation to discuss requirements"
- **Why:** People buy from people they like and trust

### 2.5 Problem-Solving First
- **Do:** "Tired of waiting months for your website?"
- **Don't:** "We build websites quickly"
- **Why:** Lead with their pain, not your solution

## 3. Tone Guidelines

### 3.1 What We Sound Like
- **Confident but not arrogant** - "We've got this" not "We're the best"
- **Friendly but professional** - Warm handshake, not best mate
- **Direct but not blunt** - Honest and clear, not harsh

### 3.2 What We Don't Sound Like
- ❌ Corporate speak ("leverage synergies")
- ❌ Tech bro ("disruptive innovation")
- ❌ Overly casual ("Hey buddy!")
- ❌ Pushy sales ("Limited time offer!")
